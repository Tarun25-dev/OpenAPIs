# 🔌 Open APIs Explorer

A simple and beginner-friendly web application that lists **free and publicly available APIs** across different domains like AI, Weather, Finance, and more.

The goal of this project is to help developers **quickly discover APIs**, understand whether they are **free, freemium, or paid**, and know if **authentication is required**, all through a clean and simple UI.
